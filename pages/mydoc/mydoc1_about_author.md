My name is Michael Vincent. I graduate in May with a Bachelors of Science in Chemical Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. I am an aspiring technical writer because I realized that I enjoyed writing essays about chemical processes more than I enjoyed working out the math itself.

The inspiration for this project came from what I felt was a lack of resources for Aspen while I was learning it in my courses. I knew that I would have appreciated having a dedicated resource that I could return to in case I got stuck on Aspen projects (which happened to be a lot). I also wanted to tackle a larger project and a user manual for my technical writing portfolio. If you're interested in seeing my full portfolio, check my website out here.

Thanks for using my Aspen user manual, and I hope it can help you out. Also big thanks to Tom Johnson of [idratherbewriting](https://idratherbewriting.com/){:target="_blank"} for the [Jekyll documentation theme](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll){:target="_blank"} and the great documentation. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me. Additionally, if you ever wish to edit or add to the manual, feel free to send a request through GitHub.
